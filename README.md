The goal of this project is to enable users to create cool web demos using the newly released OpenAI GPT-3 API with just a few lines of Python.

This project addresses the following issues:

Automatically formatting a user's inputs and outputs so that the model can effectively pattern-match
Creating a web app for a user to deploy locally and showcase their idea

Requirements
Coding-wise, you only need Python. But for the app to run, you will need:

API key from the OpenAI API beta invite
Python 3
yarn
Node 16
